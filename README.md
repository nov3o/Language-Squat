# Language Squat

The open-source recreation of [languagesquad.com](https://www.languagesquad.com/).

### Purpose

Unfortunately, the game's source code is obfuscated. Also, I don't want to train languages I already know and would like to skip these. For example, I can easily distinguish Chinese, Japanese, English, Russian, and French. Since I know these languages well, I'd like to exclude them.
