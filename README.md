# Language Squat

The open-source recreation of [languagesquad.com](https://www.languagesquad.com/).

### Purpose

Unfortunately, the game's source code is obfuscated. Also, I don't want to train languages I already know and would like to skip these. For example, I can easily distinguish Chinese, Japanese, English, Russian, and French. Since I know these languages well, I'd like to exclude them.

### Further Contribution

1. Expansion of the language set
2. Expansion of the audiofile set
3. Transition from pre-downloaded audio samples to random excerpts from the radio talk shows 
4. New mode: guess the language by the sentences. The difficulty is to discern various languages using the same scripting systems: Cyrillic, Latin, etc
   - *"–í –ö—Ä–∞–ø–∏–Ω–µ –Ω–∞–π–¥–µ–Ω—ã –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞.", "–ú–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–∏ —Å–ª–∞–¥—ä–∫.", "–¢–æ–º –ø–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–≤—Å—è."* - in three different levels you need to guess that it's Bulgarian, Russian and Ukrainian
   - *"Das Europ√§ische Parlament erh√∂hte jedoch im Vergleich zu dem urspr√ºnglichen.", "Le restaurant italien s‚Äôouvre √† midi.", "Min√§ asun tuossa kerrostalossa.", "p√• bara n√•gra minuter.", etc* - guess Swedish, German, French, Finnish by these sentences
   - Essentially, it's more difficult mode since it requires knowledge of some basic words and not just the patterns
